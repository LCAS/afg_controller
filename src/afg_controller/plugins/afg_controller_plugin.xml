      Artificial Flow Guidance (AFG) controller plugin for path following using vector field guidance.
      The AFG controller generates smooth velocity commands by combining convergence towards the path
      with flow along the path, creating a stable and predictable navigation behaviour suitable for
      outdoor navigation, long corridors, and structured environments.
